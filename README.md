LearningAid Online Learning Platform
This online learning platform is a collaborative project designed to provide users with access to a wide range of courses in various categories. Our platform is built on NextJS, HTML, and CSS for the front-end, and NodeJS and PostgreSQL for the back-end. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear navigation and well-defined features.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Contributing
We welcome everyone to contribute to this project and learn together. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, there's always something new to learn and share. You can contribute by creating issues, suggesting new features, and creating pull requests.

Before creating pull requests, please check the requirements of that piece of documentation in the Functional Design document. Each page on the website has specific requirements and suggestions for the user interface, ranging from the course catalog and enrollment page to the course review page and user profile page. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that the website provides users with a seamless and engaging experience.

Thank you for your interest in our project. We look forward to working with you and creating an amazing online learning platform together!
